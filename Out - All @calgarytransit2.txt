weren 2019t they closed because of crime

no idea they are sending out conflicting info they were open yesterday i m still going to work everyday and today suddenly no access no signage

unfortunately there were no signs on the platforms doors indicating a full closure just the ones stating 6pm to 6am the only signage was at the south end of the platform near the level crossing

-----------
thanks for clearing that up

so the station heads are now closed around the clock at those five red line stations when did that start as previously it was 6 pm to 6 am closures

when making this decision was there any consideration taken in to customers needing to take a longer walk to the bus loops and now will be missing already tight connection times due to the cut back of service

six weeks after locking down shelters at l stations you put up signs telling customers what you 2019re doing now if only you opened them back up at or near the posted time

maybe instead of punishing paying customers they should tackle the real problem why treat riders that travel between 6pm and 6am as second class customers

very sad to hear about layoffs at this time but we heard calgary 2019s mayor say 201cridership was down 90 201d yet services were only cut by 15 it 2019s no wonder calgary is having such financial hardship during these very difficult times

please ensure bus drivers are told to open back doors and not expect passengers to do so it s too hard for those with mobility issues as backdoors won t stay open unless drivers do so

this should have happened two months ago when the distancing started not now when the restrictions are going to be lifted slowly

-----------
amazing i pay 111 for a bus pass and the last two months have been nothing but horrid experiences one after another between the homeless just polluting our transit bus drivers who clearly care less about their job than most and edmonton showing calgaru how it should be done

-----------
for those who don t have a car to drive getting groceries going to the covid 19 test sites going to see the doctor just got a lot harder due to all the cancelled routes it would be a good idea to reduce the service on all the routes slated for cancelation

-----------
so everyone can ride free then good to know always see the same ones riding free

-----------
i agree service should be reduced however i don t think it should be cancelled some folks don t have cars amp can t afford a taxi ride to the grocery store and to the covid 19 test sites how are they suppose to get where they need to go if the bus isn t running in there area

-----------
for those who don t have a car to drive getting groceries going to the covid 19 test sites going to see the doctor just 2026

-----------
what is the point of making people with low incomes buy a pass s when no bus is is able to take them to from the grocery store due to the route being canceled

-----------
note i do agree with service being reduced but i also know some communities don t have grocery stores in them that are affordable which causes people to travel outside of their so they can get their needs met i also know some folks can t drive or don t have a car to drive

-----------
first announces that low income folks have to buy the bus pass then they cut some routes that serve them it makes no sense to me don t they know people in poverty live in all city quadrants

-----------
what are you people thinking with plans in the books to reopen the city and get people back to work you cut routes and reduce services this will lead to overcrowded busses resulting in a greater risk of not allowing proper social distancing and in effect increasing the risks

-----------
you are taking a complaint because the driver wouldnt let them ride free so your siding with the free riding passengers during to taking a complaint against the driver so everyone can ride free

-----------
as you can clearly see he pays bills

-----------
i mean just going to throw it out there you could be greatful that you have a place to live and shelter rather than seeing them as methheads see them as a person the reason why the homeless population is so high in calgary is because people like you are too inconsiderate to help

he did not call the metheads he said addicts which is reality we can have compassion but this does not mean we have to watch it and be fearful from being at a station our stations should be a drug alcohol free zone where we feel safe

-----------
why are you scared of drug addicts such a stigma you should be happy you have a warm coat and shelter rather than having to hide in shelters overnight to try and survive we can have compassion so what kick them out of the only place they can possibly survive ahah what a joke

-----------
no joke you dont know my story i dont need to explain why i may be fearful you dont know or obviously care about what i have experienced i am grateful for my health and my life but i or others dont have to watch others doing drugs or consuming alcohol in public spaces

-----------
so with the city starting to open too soon you reduce service when more people will be using transit crowding the busses even further making it even more of a risk for your customers and drivers great thinking

-----------
i think we get the message now you can put it to rest

they have put the drivers that have gone to work every day in a 3 day work week so they are now getting 20 hours and will not qualify for any covid19 relief

at least the mayor of edmonton stepped up to support these essential workers so they can get help to feed their families and pay their bills how disgraceful

best 2020 work at home make up to 100 per tweet

with charging a flat fee per ride not regional it s the total volume that matters in preparing a biz case the fewer riders the greater the city needs to subsidize why downtown matters if biz case was based upon a certain volume going there

just want to point out it 2019s pretty inconvenient when you keep reducing times and services yet the province announced stuff is gradually opening so morons are out here crowding trains and buses causing us to wait for different trains or buses that aren 2019t packed

i question why you would have express busses running during the shutdown 133 specifically and then may 25 when people are going back to work you chose to suspend the route that is completely backwards now is the time people will start back to work

luckily my current fear of infection on public transit has coincided with having nowhere to go

just curious given reduced ridership why not run 1 or 2 train cars instead of 3 mostly empty even with riders distanced would not running the empty carriage be more economical

i 2019m legit scared some people on transit are not respecting social distancing which makes me wonder in these uncertain times is it okay to drop kick people who refuse to keep a distance of 2m

where can i buy low income monthly pass for june 2020

-----------
there is closer to 300k trips per day when things were normal and no the city can find other means to cut like our useless public art projects and million consultants for pathways and horticultural services their contract already got gutted so the city can do something else

-----------
we really miss using public transit but it s a decision we ve made as part of the health vulnerable of the city as a result we won t be going downtown or supporting the businesses we used to access using the c train darn covid d83d de20

-----------
wednesday will be my first day back taking transit and i will be wearing a mask let 2019s come together and keep everyone safe d83d de37 a big thank you to all transit workers for continuing to show up to work and keep our city moving d83d de4f

i 2019ve retweeted a lot of lost pets over the years but i do believe this is my first spider

it s too bad that the drivers were not given plexiglass barricades to protect them from the public ask any nurse or doctor how awesome it feels to wear a mask at work all day

i can understand i ve tried over the past few times i m out but they re just too uncomfortable to wear

-----------
a reminder that service changes have started visit to plan your route

it s been going on continuously for over a year problem far from solved

also the effectiveness of a cloth mask really isn t known and would vary quite a bit anyways based on the quality of materials used

absolutely not it is about choice not to ease the fears of those around you thy chose to live in fear

absolutely not it is about human rights and choice no one should feel obligated to wear a mask to ease the 2018fears 2019 of others they chose to live in fear if one is really sick perhaps they shouldn 2019t be out or do wear a mask but leave those alone who choose not to

you can be sick and not know it it 2019s called being asymptomatic wear one or don 2019t but at least be informed in your decision and your outrage

so it it by the honour system if people have paid for their fares as i seemed to be the only one showing my transit pass when getting on the bus

-----------
masks protect others from you not the other way around

-----------
masks can be uncomfortable cloth mask effectiveness isn t known and likely pretty poor at best and those with asthma or other issues may have issues with them

-----------
i don t

-----------
holy moly pushing this a little much don t ya think

-----------
yes one showed up eventually was late for work as i rely on the first bus of the day to make it there

-----------
any updates on the digital payment option

-----------
can you confirm what the plans are for increasing the train frequency on the red and blue lines i e getting back to the pre covid schedule yyc

-----------
nope that is access denied too are you sure you want feedback

-----------
fair this just seemed like a good time to rush it forward especially with the new shields going up that seem to mostly block the fare box so it had my curious

-----------
keep drinking the koolaid anyone wearing a facemask should stay home and home isolate so the healthy people can go about their business covidbullshit

rather than sending by law why not send social workers

-----------
for this virus to be so contagious the main route of transmission must be via the smaller invisible particles which are not filtered by surgical masks or scarves or bandanas therefore trying to block the bigger particles gives a minor protection against the transmission 2 2

-----------
all the mask does for me is make it so i cant breath most dont perverted you from getting the virus maybe start kicking the crack heads off the trains other then worry about who has a mask on

-----------
if that is true i think you should just stay home at all times

-----------
yeah roughly 100 calgarians would still be alive if anyone really cared many preventable deaths if properly designed for safety not speed also a current issue developing

-----------
seriously people really have some respect for others don t make extra work for the people whi have to clean all the transit buses night put your fucking garbage where it belongs its not rocket science people

-----------
kinda hard for healthcare workers to stay at home we wear masks why it reduces the transmission of infection btwn ppl we dont let vanity amp ego get in the way of common sense unlike those refusing to wear masks we engage in analytical cognitive behaviour to keep ppl safe

-----------
wrong masks do decrease the chance of shared vontagion and infections you dont think surgeons wear them as a fashion statement do you d83d de44

-----------
please keep an eye out for this missing tarantula

-----------
they do not wear cloth masks they wear medical grade masks that have filters surgeons wear masks to protect the patient from their germs entering the patient learn to read before you comment

-----------
a lesson in history we started wearing cotton masks in the or and on tb units a hundred years ago cause guess what they discovered it helped reduce the mode of transmission of contagion and infections good lawwrd broaden your scope of knowledge

no thanks suck it

wondering if unused transit passes from a book of 10 purchased in 2019 can still be used

the body is smart it notifies you when you have a virus trying to rid it your body will show symptoms somehow i think the asymptomatic business is additional propaganda to keep us all in funny how people roam around when they have a cold go to work school etc

are we still using cotton masks no we aren t they are not effective if you care for a tb patient they are on airborne precautions meaning full ppe with and n95 mask that has to fit tested to your face you yet no protection against the virus with a cloth mask

why do we need to give single ride ticket if the drivers wouldn 2019t give transfer pass so if we need to ride more than 1 bus we need to give 2 tickets which will cost 7

and it is not ideal for people who works only few hrs a week to buy a monthly pass either is it ok to just pay with coins

how will i validate if i don 2019t ride ctrain

ok i 2019ll see if other driver will accept that thanks

the westbound 153 bus reached stop 9616 at 7 43 today and i was told earlier this week that it was due at 7 50 please tell your drivers that being early may mean up to an additional 30 minute wait for passengers it has happened to me earlier this week

i wear a mask at work it keeps others safe slightly reduces my exposure and helps spread the message that we can beat this virus if we stay vigilant with our new routines sanitizing mask handling hand washing etc stay safe smart and strong yyc

-----------
i wear a mask as a sign of respect to those around me

-----------
there also nothing if they need to pay cash or need a transfer it 2019s looks like it free and i should do it because everyone else is i 2019m not but guessing people are thinking that i thanked my bus drivers some are nice and other grumpy i get it it 2019s strange times

-----------
enough we get it

-----------
i wear one when i go to the grocery store i 2019ll be taking for the first time in 10 week on monday and i 2019ll wear one then too even though as far as i know i 2019m not sick it protects front line workers who risk their health everyday

hey how can bus riders pay with tickets i 2019ve been trying to find information online but couldn 2019t find what i was looking for

studies are showing wearing masks are worse than not you tend to touch your face more no body wears them right and they don 2019t protect anything

unfortunately not everyone will be doing the honourable thing but thanks again for your quick response to my question

can riders rind the bell when their stop is approaching

agreed i have been able to reduce my use of ct a lot since the pandemic hit but the dozen or so times i have had to only one driver was wearing a mask and that was pre rear door boarding if ct is going to preach to us about it they should practice what they preach
