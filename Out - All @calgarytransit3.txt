i said 100 yrs ago do you have difficulty reading of course us healthcare workers wear medical grade masks on duty off duty we wear whatever mask bandana scarf you can find if you are not able to safe distance a cotton mask is better than no mask

-----------
the 129 sage hill set to leave at 5 25 has either left early or hasn 2019t shown up at all

-----------
i don t want to be the one who makes my friends my family and other people around me sick that is why i wear the mask every time i go out in public

-----------
nope and will provide them to all albertans

my point is that things have changed from 100 years ago they would have stayed the same if those masks were effective but they are not

well when your on a bus your not exactly performing a tracheostomy risk of a high viral load is unlikely unless your on 1 wearing a cotton mask will suffice in protection from asymptomatic carriers who get too close sneeze spit eat or have poor hygenic behaviour on board

oh absolutely another beautiful day out

-----------
let these people know your concerns

i know it s of limited effectiveness in protecting me from the virus directly but i kind of hope the fact i m wearing one keeps the un masked a safe distance away by their thinking i m sick also it has bunnies on it

-----------
have you asked the provincial government if you could give them out do it publicly here now since people taking transit most likely do not have a car to get to drive through fast food joints for some earn your fares

might want to put up somewhere that you can t get low income bus passes at village square location

is this still happening

are your drivers wearing mask s

thank you

no and these are automated tweets so you won t likely get a response to this obvious question

it 2019s cheaper to make it 100 accessible now if it 2019s done that way from the start you won 2019t have to renovate it in the future unlike what has happened at rundle and is now happening in marlborough

can people get mask when they buy their low income bus pass now the reason i m asking is because according to this website it s available to transit users now in both and

-----------
good d83d dc4d

-----------
are the busses supposed to be this full

-----------
according to the provincial government website it says the cities of edmonton and calgary have each been supplied 500 000 masks and will be responsible for distributing them mainly through their transit operations source

-----------
homeless shelters and women shelters are for people who don t have a permanent address people who don t have an permanent address can t get the adult and seniors low income bus pass

-----------
i hope that includes the driver i couldn t understand why she was stopping to let more people on when every available seat was taken

-----------
if the mask is already on property customer service staff should be ready to hand it out to the riders when they buy their bus passes and tickets in addition to that cta drivers should hand it out to their riders too

-----------
couldn t see the bus number this was route 1 at 4 50 coming into inglewood from downtown

Bus route:Bowness - Forest Lawn

people with mobility disabilities can t enter and exit the back door they enter and exit the front door since it s the only one that has a ramp what is being done to protect both the passenger and the driver in this case

-----------
caucasian male and female the girl has dark red brown hair and the guy is covering his head with a sweater

-----------
how come ct bus drivers aren t given a mask when they need to step out of their vehicles to go use a public washroom i saw the driver for 1 bowness bus ask someone at tim hortons today ask if he can use the toilet i felt bad when the th staff said no mask no service

Bus route:Bowness - Forest Lawn

good question hopefully the fact is sending mask to them helps them protect their staff and passengers

-----------
admits it s hard to maintain physicaldistancing on their vehicles since that is the truth it is a good idea for them to give the mask provided to everyone on board their vehicles

-----------
yes i did thank you the app was working right i think

hey why is there no physical distancing on ctrains very scary to ride you should require riders at least to mask up what do you think just saying my wife will not ride transit it is not safe

-----------
the poors have to get them on the bus somehow is getting a shipment

-----------
what i am struggling with is buying low income passes i can t get to the 3 4 places that sell them credit card is maxed due to covid calgon take me away d83d de02

-----------
the 3 carts are getting pretty full in the morning be much better idea just to do it now

-----------
they re losing so much money i don t think they can afford to have personal policing social distancing and mask wearing they ve been recommending both since covid began here

-----------
so riders who pay for the low income passes are at high risk of covid someone 2019s income doesn 2019t not affect who gets covid and who doesn 2019t

-----------
people living in poverty are at higher risk of getting covid 19 because they don t have enough money to get the food and supplies they need to stay safe and healthy

-----------
people in calgary who have a higher income than those who get the low income bus pass can afford to do things like buy groceries drive a car thru mcdonalds tim hortons or a amp w to get the mask has provided buy hand sanitzer and lysol wipes pay rent on time

Location name:calgary
Coodinates:51.047306060791016,-114.05796813964844
-----------
when people can afford to eat healthy food get a mask buy disinfectant and hand sanitizers as well as soap and pay rent on time they have a better chance of being able to heal from covid 19 people who get the low income bus pass can t afford those things without help

-----------
when we the people in poverty don t get the help they need to stay healthy everyone ends up at risk that is why i mentioned a priority system to calgary transit they don t have enough mask to give to everyone who rides with them

-----------
by helping the people in poverty and people in other vulnerable groups get the mask there is a chance we can stop the spread of covid 19 or at least lessen the impact of it in society calgary transit can t provide people in poverty a home to self isolate

it s a simple duty amp responsibility for transit users to wear masks who s gon na drive the bus if the drivers get ill or dies it s also a show of respect otherwise we should employ shame that often works take it from a post wwii boomer

can you tell me how often 65 runs on weekends the app says the next bus is 55 minutes away that can not possibly be right

-----------
3986 it just showed up even though the app said it wouldn 2019t be here for another 50 min

-----------
1 i know i complain a lot and may be written off as a crank and i 2019m sorry but like tens of thousands of calgarians i absolutely depend on ct the price of my bus pass keeps going up and the service i 2019m paying for keeps going down that 2019s insane

-----------
2 route 65 was ntroduced to replace 22 122 407 and nearby 9 10 we lost all those options and now the wait between 65s is 40 minutes and the app has an alert that says the wait will be 45 minutes from now on

Bus route:Market Mall-Downtown West
Bus route:Market Mall-Downtown West
-----------
3 it is simply wrong for the coty and ct to ask calgarians to drive less and take the bus if there is no bus or adequate bus service when we pay for a ticket or bus pass we want to ride a bus not be taken for a ride or thrown under the bus

-----------
maybe if we could get free uber when we show a valid bus pass

-----------
the impact is painful and negative and there is no reasonable expectation it won 2019t continue to get worse because ct has been gaslighting is with the same script for years can we petition to replace the route 65 and get the other routes back

i hope that the do include disabled people and seniors throughout the entire design and construction process for the greenline so right from the start all of the stations and bus stops along the route would be 100 accessible

-----------
that way both and would not need to revisit and renovate the greenline in the future to make it more accessible this would save tax payers and the city in general a lot of time to include advocacy groups for ex in on the project

might want to tell drivers of your community shuttles small buses they re asking for fares to be put in the fare box which is great and all unless the passenger is continuing on with another bus train twice this past week i saw people upset when they could not get a transfer

-----------
i know we are still required to pay are we required to show the ticket pass when boarding is my question i know the 201chonour system 201c was in place i am just clarifying if that is still the case i didn 2019t see anything regarding that

that 2019s fine but why not communicate it better i had to find out when my bus driver told me i can 2019t get on today

those shower curtains are a hazard for drivers on my bus the curtain kept sliding and the driver kept moving it and almost side swiped someone this can 2019t be safe

it s too far for some to go for tourist it be really nice if the ride goes from the hotel to a ctrain station by making that happen it would also encourage cta to pick up drop off clients there since they go where ct has a fixed route service

the path going to the casino is inaccessible for disabled folks and tourist with luggage the on demand ct would remove that barrier it would also make it safer for employees of the grey eagle to go home at night

they do but for some reason there employee areas example staff washrooms are disgusting so gross they get featured on national tv shows including under cover boss canada

good morning the number 4 stop southbound edmonton tr at 6 ave ne could use some tlc there is a box of clothes strewn around in the shelter

-----------
thanks have a great day

-----------
good morning my friends have a wonderful day thank you for your service thank you for all you do your amazing i love you all

-----------
i find the gif a little disturbing though

-----------
it says contactless is it barcodes that get scanned like the myfare trial last year or nfc tap based

-----------
i 2019m the only person out of ten on the number 3 wearing a mask sad d83d de37

-----------
sign of the times parking lot maybe 20 cars two of us waiting for a bus and no busses in the loop

-----------
hi did you get my reply

-----------
the devices look more like barcode readers than nfc in which case how does this system get around the possibility of screenshots of a monthly pass

-----------
many transit systems portland since 2013 use barcodes each fare would have unique not easily predictable barcode so each monthly pass would be different transit tickets already have unique serial numbers how spoof proof it is will depend on implementation

-----------
so each monthly pass will have different barcode or qr code

-----------
right but does that barcode change after each use a month pass would need to be a time limited but in theory infinite supply of single use barcodes nobody has ever explained how the month pass would work

-----------
no different than sharing your paper monthly pass if the same barcode stays it will definitely be time limited likely to calendar month i would anticipate at least a system lockout time so if you scan a monthly pass now same monthly pass can t be scanned for next 90 minutes

-----------
but that makes transfers impossible making a round trip to a grocery store

-----------
and the paper passes with holograms are harder to duplicate than it is to screenshot and airdrop like i said nobody has explained how this will work

-----------
i think once you scan a fare hit an activate button as you would for single fare on l it remains active reusable scannable on that device for 90 minutes need to get the app to see details but hopefully all of this is sorted from trial lots of other systems use barcodes

-----------
will you be able to use a visa debit card to pay for tickets or a pass

-----------
that 2019s great will paper tickets still work i have two packs still

-----------
this is actually a big help so we dont have to go to places just to buy a transit pass

-----------
amazing news i have been waiting so long for this to happen and can 2019t wait to use it

-----------
will low income monthly passes work on the app

-----------
do you know when they planned to be added

-----------
so the buses cleaned often at least every night is it just a coincidence that i took the 93 home from work last night and noticed 2 zip ties tied together on the floor of the bus near the bench seats by the back door and they 2019re still there today

-----------
that 2019s awesome but 1 question i purchase a monthly pass my phone dies prior to the end of my shift and i can 2019t tap the scanner now what

-----------
wear a mask

-----------
would you be willing to accept personal and professional liability for personal injury related to people wearing masks who correspondingly suffer a drop in blood oxygen partial pressure

-----------
study not applicable no one in this group or on the planet is advocating for public use of n95s cloth masks surgical masks can be worn comfortably and are a helpful source control measure to reduce potentially virus laden droplets from entering the surrounding enviro

-----------
i think a more interesting question is this knowing what we now know about the prevalence of asymptomatic spread and the value of masks as source control is there a positive duty to mandate

-----------
wait how does this work i can t see his tweet anymore this reply was hidden by the original tweet author sigh for the late comers it was a bogus argument suggesting some sort of liability for mandating masks never mind

-----------


-----------
will transfers be given out

-----------
what is a cw or a cvv number it mentions you will have to remember it but it doesn t say what it is

-----------
love showing up to my stop 5 mins before the bus is scheduled to come not seeing a bus walking over and it being ten minutes past it s normal time guess bus stop times are totally made up now

-----------
welcome to calgary transit where the buses are decrepit and the times don t matter

-----------
yeah i super love just waiting around all the time because buses can just show up whenever they want what a joke of a service

-----------
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz sitting here since 1 42 so that bus went by what 1 38 i can see the stop from my work didn t see any bus going by what a joooooke d83e dd21 d83e dd21

-----------
i remember selina having to uber when it was really cold because the bus just didn t stop for her

-----------
i honestly can not stand that especially when they pass stops early though shouldn t be a thing i left work early to try to miss the rain and now i don t have a connecting bus when i get off

faq says if you wan na use e fare up to you to make sure your phone is working charged remember paper fares aren 2019t going away

-----------
why is there no mention of riders without smartphones despite a lengthy faq section also 90 minutes is insufficient time to complete many trips across the city especially with the current decreased bus frequency

-----------
i doubt will appear on this very short list of cities that support applepay with express transit mode 2026 maybe the slightly longer list that supports standard applepay 2026 i kinda doubt it but i would love to be wrong

thrilled we re a big city now convenience helps thx

i hope for the sake of accessibility and safety the low bus pass can be purchased on this app soon actionhall nocontact mask

only 10 percent of passengers wearing masks on my train ride home yesterday lots of people on the train too very scary

-----------
yesterday we took a long trip through downtown and same transit employee was on for 4 stops not masked agreed t is very scary more enforcement is needed

-----------
i was the only one wearing a mask on my bus yesterday this included the driver who was front door boarding had no mask and there was no barrier between him and us social distancing wasn 2019t being followed either this is why taking transit is a last resort

-----------
please consider to add more trains trains are really crowded now hard to keep social distance from other fellow passengers

-----------
almost nobody is wearing a mask for anyone today out of 20 people on my bus only me and one other person wore masks

trying to get home from work and wasn t let on the bus because three other people pushed ahead when the driver told us how many people could get on i was the only person wearing a mask pretty angry about this run more buses at this time this is completely unfair

if you are that worried maybe just stay home

so is it going to be madiitory to wear a mask on the buses at this as some people due to breathing issues can not wear masks

-----------
how much did it cost calgarian 2019s failed 2 attempts to try and build the ticketing system and why are we 15 years behind all other major cities on this

so will it be mandatory to now wear masks on the bus and trains as some people have breathing issues and if so can a driver refuse that person from getting on the bus

remember most people who live in these places don 2019t have access to the internet yet they still need their pass to go see their doctor their friends and family some aish clients live in these places despite the fact they 2019re not seniors yet

you might have me to remind the people at the train station to wear gloves when handing out i saw one of the people the other day holding the masks without gloves on i said no thanks as i don 2019t no were those hands are clean or not

-----------
when is the ios app going to be available will it be later today or a few weeks i don 2019t understand why you just didn 2019t say that it will only be available on android first and ios later then people would have known they needed to go out and buy a pass

searching for 201cmy fare 201d or 201cmy fare calgary 201d on the apple app store does not show the app do you have a direct link to the download

is the app called my fare can t find it on google play

-----------
happy canada day i 2019m looking for the new app my fare and i can 2019t find it has it been launch

my point being is that you 2019re asking people to download it from the app store now i 2019m sure i 2019m not the only one looking for it given the system is live today

-----------
it is still not available can i use my june pass

hello is the transit free for canada day

hopefully soon was looking forward to using transit again this month and the new app so hard to find passes in my area cash it is till the app is available

this is just perfect failure to launch again mistakes happen but launch day

oh man

-----------
this d83d dc46 d83c dffb wasn 2019t planning on going to a store today but now have to make a trip to get a pass

-----------
anyone here surprised didn t think so yyccc

-----------
on the ct site suggest this be updated if incorrect is my fare available on all devices my fare is available on the majority of ios or android devices installed with the current or previous major version operating system older versions of software may not be supported

-----------
in addition to linking to the apps actually put them on the app stores they are still missing

-----------
any news on when the myfare app will be on the apple store some of us need to use the bus tomorrow and would like to check out the app before we get tickets and reprimands from the peace officers

-----------
so it seems like nobody actually submitted the my fare app to the apple store really guys i guess the tech team remains as incompetent as ever but how many hits to your reputation can they get away with

i 2019m on an apple phone

-----------
is there a link to the ios version of my fare it doesn 2019t come up in the search

-----------
can you explain how this happened you announced a july 1 launch more than a week ago and yet the app isn 2019t available for iphones

thanks

-----------
no cash and need to take transit to get a fare

-----------
can you provide a timeline is it days away weeks months

-----------
how am i supposed to get on the bus when the app isn 2019t available and i don 2019t have time to go to the store and get tickets ridiculous honestly

-----------
the app doesn t even work some people have complained about it

-----------
this morning i had to take the bus just wondering if everything is back to normal now front of the bus boarding giving out transfers no screens lack of distancing on the bus and no masks but same signage about covid19 rules has something changed

-----------
the masks was more about having close contact with the driver while paying fare entering from front of bus and the driver has had endless contact with people in a day and wasnt wearing one nor using the screen its as much about their safety as ct riders

-----------
so is the app you are pushing one of the reasons why the sev by my house doesn t have july passes

-----------
thank you for clarifying

-----------
is the my fare app live yet can t find it on the ios app store

-----------
actually can you please clarify the mask and distancing dealio

-----------
pro tip having a more detailed tweet about it being limited to only android users at the moment would avoid further customer confusion also update the page you link to for more info as it says it is available on both android and ios platforms d83e dd2a

-----------
why did ct wait till the midnight hour to launch this out public information has been collasially weak its like your taking pr pointers from the ucp not a good look your coaches and stops have no app info for riders to learn about this even social media has been slack

-----------
hi pls make an apple watch app for calgary transit app and the new my fare when it comes out on ios specially now people don 2019t wnat their phones out often in public they are dirtier than most belongings

-----------
recept should be valid enough at this point its a cash grab very poor pr

-----------


-----------
the only thing that doesn t clarify is the drivers this morning our driver wasn t wearing a mask screen left open mask aside they have the most frequent contact with riders and are high risk themselves and to the riders for catching cov19 esp when passing out transfers

-----------
is there a timeline for the ios app is it being moderated by apple thanks

-----------
can we still pay with regular bus tickets i plan to wait to see how this all rolls out i asked this same question yesterday but didnt get a response trying again

-----------
this actually has made it harder app not available for ios and regular passes not a available at regular stores and shops what a mess d83d de44

-----------
sorry ct i would rather not at this time as i don t want one employee to be reprimanded when i m just asking about transit as a whole

-----------
oh my yes please wear gloves

-----------
thank u happy canada day d83e dd70 d83e dd70

-----------
so ppl will start paying again there have been a lot of non fare paying riders the last couple months

-----------
did you mean the end of july

-----------
next time get the app through apple 2019s app store review publicly available for download and pilot tested before publishing on your website it 201cis available 201d and committing to a hard launch date

-----------
i think the issues may be substantial relating to payment model for single tickets amp monthly passes storage in apple wallet availability on all devices privacy amp security ownership of purchase data payment with apple store credit web app may have been better

-----------
yes actually the app has made it much harder to buy your fares stores didnt bother to stock passes expecting riders to download the app which isnt a available for everyone what a mess how are you rectifying this

-----------
yikes i didn 2019t say anything when they announced the launch because i wasn 2019t going to get all excited until i had it in hand now we wait

-----------
except many of those vendors havent re opened do you have a link to these vendors for purchasing

-----------
transport for london has an app for its contactless and oyster cards they ask you wait up to 30 min for your purchase to be available in the app it has a 1 3 out of 5 rating from 11 reviews in the canadian store

-----------
next question where can i buy more my current package will run out after tomorrow is their a online list of vendors ive checked the safewayx shoppers and even a 7 11 in my neighbourhood nothing

-----------
thank you hope you re having a good wednesday

what is myfare app how long has this been a thing

-----------
not really wtf the fact that i have to run to an atm if i need to take a bus could pay atm fees and then get a 20 that i need change for nah they needed this on the bus ages ago this will help a lot of people

it launched today

can we still board at the back of the bus and rip our tickets or everyone boards at the front again

developers get app store connect to see progress invite testers or media to take a pre release 201ctestflight 201d and choose whether to release as soon as app is approved or at future date after approval you know the smart way tied to a launch date

also launching a new product simultaneously in both platforms is foolish work the bugs out and adapt your features on one platform first if you 2019re planning to sell tickets or passes in the app to candian public using credit cards you start with ios

-----------
so was the mayor and director of transit lying or just grossly misinformed when they told everyone at yesterday 2019s press conference to use it starting today perhaps it would have been wise to have it ready to go before promoting to the public

-----------
i agree that this system is long overdue but it is problematic when it doesn t work properly this isn t the first time though they spent a fortune twice on the connect tap and go fare card system back in 2012 that ultimately didn t even work

-----------
couldn 2019t have told us before july 1

-----------
any chance you can put the link to the exact app on google play there is not one called myfare

-----------
i can t find myfare for for android i know you said it s not available for ios but i can t find it for my samsung either

-----------
just noticed there is no space between my and fare my bad

-----------
deal breaker transit tickets purchased in app expire 7 days from date of purchase and can not be refunded appears to violate apple store policies maybe federal law if this is like movie passes c

-----------
explain to me why your drivers are allowed to be verbally abusive and then twist it onto customers i was struggling to find change and as i tried to pay on my way off as i had to spend the trip finding not enough change your driver called me a dumb cunt

-----------
and didn 2019t answer the question excellent job cc

-----------
can i get my mouthy pass on the my fare app

-----------
well that is interesting

-----------
i 2019m better off buying a book of 10 tickets they don 2019t expire and if prices go up 10 cents you pay with a ticket dime pretty sure you can get refund on unused ticket books too if i buy monthly pass in app then app crashes or is deleted is pass lost too

-----------
this is why it should have been launched mid month imagine thinking you could download the app and buy your monthly pass then you find out someone dropped the ball and now you have to scramble for bus fare and then find somewhere that has a paper pass it off to a good start

-----------
what about low income passes

-----------
one should be able to use there pre purchased ticket anytime no matter how it is payed for get rid of the 6 day time period to use the fare via the app

-----------
why most people using transit these days are retail workers and our hours are still the same today all this will do is make it even more difficult to practice social distancing on ctrains and buses

-----------
you 2019re kidding right new my fare app not made available for iphones what were you thinking d83e dd37 d83c dffb 200d 2642 fe0f

this if correct there are simple basic laws and rules that you must follow and why we were asking questions before this went live today

they still haven t addressed privacy questions info collected who collects it how they maintain it think tim s app situation disclosing up front to users fairly standard to consider pre launch can people volunteer at the city they seem to need some help in a few areas

so when is this going to be a thing for the hundreds of thousands of apple users here we are at the end of the first day and apple users are still unable to get the app wouldn 2019t this have been taken care of in the testing phase when can we expect it to be in the app store

so not surprised is disappointment again and again and they wonder why ridership is down and probably won t come back

-----------
and here s vancouver kicking our butts in the easy to use transit department geez your think they could manage this

you can buy it whenever from wherever why do you need to buy in bulk makes no sense

your own advertising at train stations say the app is available on the app store website also says it 2019s available there too d83d de1e

it 2019s likely out of the developer 2019s hands in those of the apple release team who approves the apps for the apple store that said this app should have been released a month ago so it would be ready to launch today as advertised

-----------
i can t even find it on android

they can 2019t afford to do that that 2019s why they both cut service and enforced fare payment during the recent states of the pandemic

-----------
fit their pretend narrative

-----------
just fuckin aweful

-----------
bus was never free pay your fare and stfu

-----------
you want free transit yet bitch constantly about funding are you fucking stupid

-----------
no need to apologize giving feedback on the new app thank you

-----------
and yet another reason why management there needs to beer shaken up

-----------
ridiculous that this is even an issue someone needs to be held accountable for this massive failure how can we trust the app now that we have been let down massively in day one thought i 2019d was tested before rollout we want real answers keep checking is not an answer

-----------
so i got yelled at for trying to pay my fare on the bus so i didn t bring any change the next time and i got yelled at for not paying what is it do we pay to get on the bus or not

bus is the 19 8346 this time passengers were let on from the front it is just a really mixed message and i don t know what the hell to do when i get on a bus anymore

i know we have had our differences in the past but i must give praise where praise is do this new myfare digital ticket app is everything okayyyyyyy gwan wit yo bad self i m here for it

-----------
i can scan my myfare pass on any other buses but bus number 10 why is that how can i fix that because it s so annoying and embarrassing

-----------
typical fuck up

-----------
the bigger question is why do single tickets expire on the app after a week the printed tickets in books of ten have no such expiration date

-----------


-----------


-----------
that doesn t explain why they have expiry dates to begin with

-----------
printed tickets do have an expiration they effectively expire when there is a ticket price increase there is a loop hole for printed tickets if you have cash for the fare increase the printed ticket plus coins can be deposited into bus fare box and a transfer receipt issued

-----------
losers

-----------
how about low income passes please

-----------
you don t explain why once again in small words why do tickets on the app expire when physical tickets do not

-----------
i m using printed tickets book of 10 printed tickets that require validation through stamp printed tickets from the l vending machines come all ready validated and expire 90 minutes after pruchase am i missing something

-----------
if i buy a book of 10 tickets in november and validate a ticket the following january after the price has increased 0 15 that validation is not effective this is from numerous transit peace officers who conduct fare validation checks in january

-----------
i can t find the myfare app in the google play store a search for myfare turns up nothing other than the existing calgary transit app

-----------
so it 2019s still inconvenient for those of us that need low income passes

-----------
this is not good enough we want answers as to why this happened

-----------
how long is the process going to take

-----------
confusion due to over the years twitter acct said 2 different things yes still valid no aren t plus conflicting responses from transit drivers too downtown office says don t expire now new app it s an internal amp external policy awareness amp inconsistent messaging issue

-----------
thank you found it

-----------
by valid people think yes ok to use at face value even if price increase or yes can use them but have to pay top up increase so if have a paper ticket for 1 amp price now 1 25 inconsistent messaging whether you have to pay the extra 25 or not amp what valid means

-----------
bus route 23 it 2019s now a small shuttle it 2019s impossible to follow social distancing please check on that

Bus route:52 Street East
-----------
how long will it take for my bus pass to be mailed to me i purchased it june 26 and it 2019s july 2 now

-----------
deal breaker transit tickets purchased in app expire 7 days from date of purchase and 2026

-----------
prepaid cards for services with monetary value i 2019m not a lawyer bu 2026

-----------
almost every time when looking for extra coins boarding bus w older paper ticket after annual price increase kind transit driver says oh don t bother with it just put ticket in with old price it s fine even if the coin is in my hand already i put it in regardless

-----------
deal breaker transit tickets purchased in app expire 7 days from date of purchase and 2026

-----------
clearly you have some details to sort out how about you get back to us in a day or two once things are a tad clearer and then pass that info on to your drivers and peace officers so everyone is on the same page there s no shame in this but fix it

-----------
you already get a discount and the process has not changed so not sure what the problem is

-----------
you can also take your pre increase tickets to customer service and use them as a credit toward purchasing current tickets their value never just disappears

-----------
passes are available online on the 6th of the month even earlier than retail they mail very quickly usually 2 business days 1 for the city 1 for canada post but of course they can take longer

-----------
if a bureaucrat working on a project actually gets it done then he she is out of a job so they show progress from time to time but never actually get finished they ve been working on this cashless fare project for over 10 years

-----------
and keep in mind that this is no less than yyycc s third attempt to launch a payment app for this article from 2017

-----------
between this and the twitter conversation around whether physical tickets are valid only at face value or valid period definitely sounds like a lack of communication within calgary transit it sounds like your drivers and transit officers are not working on the same information

how come people are getting on and off at the front of the bus again unsafe the drivers plastic curtain isnt even pulled all the way to protect the driver

-----------
i went into the office a day last week for the first time since this started and the c train felt like the least safe part of the experience by a wide margin d83e dd14

-----------
i wonder is transsubc trainstation the act of using a promise that you re heading to buy a pass as a form of bus fare

-----------
thank you d83d de0a

-----------
then what 2019s the point of these

-----------
then what is the point of these like what

-----------
love it

-----------
so i asked a driver why they were letting people through the front door they were very nice they said it was because is losing money on people not paying fairs what a shock at least this driver was actually using the plastic screen

-----------
they havent taken all of the signs off of all the buses yet that will be removed

-----------
great stuff great leadership its been a painful 3 months waiting for masking to become a thing

-----------
just used my fare for the first time showed it to the scanner and it said just used even though i just activated it had to show the driver i just activated it for him to let me on

-----------
thanks is it possible to know if they will be available later today or tomorrow

-----------
it okay me right now the my fare not out on ios apple user i shave booklets of ticket to last me until it out

-----------
i agree this is 2020 should have a login system to buy your passes regardless of what type of pass you purchase then implement that into the myfare app

-----------
just tried again on different bus it said regular show id for about 3 seconds then went away driver told me to try again and it said just used again it s a youth single ticket that i purchased yesterday and activated at 2pm why is it doing this

-----------
i thought they were supposed to be mandatory

-----------
thank you

-----------
are passengers still able to pay a cash fare on buses

-----------
ok thank you

-----------
valid point for me it s about limiting transactions

-----------
nope not mandatory just a suggestion

-----------
i usually buy a low income bus pass i just ordered one online so how do a take transit until the pass comes in

agree brian thank you it s often not in sync hoping helps them in some small way by sharing info appreciate all they do if they know what we have seen for years now perhaps they can address it maybe staff training turnover not sure what root cause is exactly

hi i understand that if you pay for a ticket with myfareapp and take the ctrain peace officers can demand to see the ticket on your phone that opens a pretty huge can of worms what rules are in place to prevent officers from going through your phone

hi i understand that if you pay for a ticket with myfareapp and take the ctrain peace officers can d 2026

i saw that the reason this app was launched to prevent people from interacting with your staff reducing the chance of getting covid 19 if that is true how come seniors and people living in poverty can 2019t get their pass on it yet

-----------
hi i understand that if you pay for a ticket with myfareapp and take the ctrain peace officers can d 2026

-----------
phone is dead then you can 2019t produce a valid fare on demand ticket for you i guess

-----------
why would the officer need to go into your phone you show the pass on the app they scan it and you are done not sure what you think is going to happen here

-----------
both groups are in the high risk categories

-----------
the reason poor people are at risk is because they can 2019t self isolate when they got no place to call home they can 2019t afford to buy hand sanitizer mask etc due to being food insecure they may develop disease like diabetes

-----------
when we don 2019t help the poor and the elderly people by reducing in person contact we may be making the spread of covid 19 worse include their low income and seniors bus passes on the app please

which remain available no plans to phase out

how come your drivers aren 2019t required to wear mask maskupcanada mask4allcanadians if you want ridersto wear the mask you 2019re giving to them staff should lead by example and wear it

-----------
you re confusing paying for an ap and wanting an ap as the same thing

-----------
some peoples texts pop up on the screen if a text email comes through and the officer decides it looks suspicious

-----------
your drivers need to be protected better since drivers do step off their bus during their time breaks and when someone needs help boarding the vehicles please give them a mask to wear that way the public will be encouraged to wear the mask ct gives properly

-----------
drivers deserve to have the mask they need while they are at a bus stop or standing on the ctrain platform not just while they are inside the vehicles

-----------
given that paper tickets no longer expire when the fare goes up i can only see disadvantages to using the app

-----------
it 2019s actually strike three millions lost on two failed attempts with the telvent schneider smart connect card lots of major cities bigger than yyc with electronic transit pay systems that work for everyone

-----------
it 2019s great for tourists and family groups who don 2019t typically take transit and won 2019t be boarding at a location that has a vending machine i 2019ll also be using it for monthly pass

i m not a lawyer but isn t there a ruling that police officers in canada may access your phone if is unlocked they should only be able to scan the code on the app without touching you or the phone when you use the app the phone is unlocked

first time seeing a new apple app release eh

or got to ride the bus for free more likely you should be complaining on apples page really they the ones to blame and they always pull shifty stuff

thats a good question seems odd they would be any different although if its just single tickets then it shouldn t make much difference if 10 packs had an expiry then that would be an issue

-----------
this is amazing what a deal

-----------
it didn 2019t fail at launch apple had issues publishing it on their end y 2019all love bitching for the sake of bitching holy

-----------
you had me worried there for a sec it looks like there indeed is one

-----------
hahaha incredible buy

-----------
hey why aren 2019t your drivers wearing masks

-----------
that makes no sense i can buy a book of paper tickets and keep them indefinitely but the electronic ticket has an expiry date

-----------
that just means it s a youth pass it will always scan with a yellow screen and say show id

-----------
nop it was through an app

-----------
nop it was through the app

-----------
trying to get some info on safety precautions ct is taking for covid 19 but getting an access denied banner any help would be appreciated

-----------
now you 2019re getting it

-----------
this was a huge mistake in doing that huge benefit to allowing people to load up on tickets in advance

harass them by waking them up i don 2019t understand someone obviously was concerned about them and called the transit cops to come check on them wake them up and ge them some place safe that is harassment

-----------
wow man lol you need help

-----------
okay thank you

-----------
this should be corrected i want to purchase a batch of tickets for the month will be working at home 3 days a week and want to make the one time purchase when o need tickets for the month how is this an oversight

-----------
please address asap it is not hard to address

-----------
now this icon here your worship is our cutting edge social distancing app it tells you if someone is within 2 m and has fingerprint recognition to tell if someone accessed high touch areas such as your smartphone d83d de01 c

-----------
if you ve ever taken transit you ve seen them walk past the sleeping white guy and wake up the native demanding pass asking where they re going

-----------
ok there bud you got me

-----------
i would guess that most people have never once thought about how the data on their device could seem suspicious to a cop and be used against them and what they might do about it that s what makes this show your phone to transit police policy so dangerous

-----------
how would they know if you have purchased a fare then they have psychic abilities

-----------
haha why do guys care if you bought a single ticket at the train station it would expire in 2 hours if you want a book buy a book lol

-----------
i dont think you know how the apps work if you just said that and only believe that riding the bus isn t free no but if someone showed up already paid for their apple ticket and it was broken you can t believe the bus driver made those riders get off the bus

-----------
you missed the whole point but ok thanks for your very useless input

-----------
the point was that the app was unavailable to hundreds of thousands of people duh

-----------
the question isn t whether they need you to leave the app but whether they could legally take the now unlocked phone and look through it a canadian border officer told me to unlock my phone at the airport a few years back so she could look through it not sure how that s legal

-----------
i think you 2019re missing the point when you 201cbuy a book 201d imagine if those tickets expired after 7 days whether used or not that would be obnoxious and also pointless

-----------
another reason why this app is a huge failure and disappointment

-----------
how do i add can i add my already purchased monthly pass to the app

-----------
i can see you are a regular transit user monthly pass cards printed tickets this app nonsense is to eventually remove those means ct said in the thread it s your responsibility to keep your phone charged or get the massive fines

-----------
thanks

i still have 5 tickets from 2019 as i went nowhere due to health concerns and then lockdown are they any good still

-----------
probably because many drivers aren t using their mask or closing the protective curtain let me feign shock gasp it s like they re rife with employees who don t give a damn

-----------
purchased a single ticket with new my fare app not activated and it expires in 6 days why 2026

-----------
no it failed because they should have submitted the app to apple more than 48 hours before they went live with it it continues to fail because of restrictions or limitations that would seem common sense but ct didn 2019t consider or chooses not to address

-----------
this doesn 2019t make any sense at all and should be corrected as soon as possible 201cplanning ahead 201d would be to buy tickets ahead of time so you have them when you need them so far it doesn 2019t make sense to use the app more testing should have been done ahead of time

-----------
the latest david s tree service daily newspaper thanks to chichester socialnetworking

-----------
no it failed because despite testing it for a very long time they failed to test adequately and submitted a sub standard app the developer should have known better someone from the city and transit should have been over seeing this and they all dropped the ball

-----------
so bathroom brakes aren 2019t ok eh

can we still use paper tickets if we have them are you boarding from the front now or how do we show our proof of fare

thats what i was thinking but the show id thing was only on the screen for such a short amount of time that the driver cant even see what it says before it goes away

you also i hope you get to enjoy some of this sunshine

it would show a yellow light as opposed to a green light for a normal pass if the driver sees the light they should know

-----------
when the bus has already been sitting for a while and is then running late i have a problem with it i fully understand that drivers are entitled to breaks i pay for the bus to run on time though

-----------
again today it seems that because i m using a youth ticket that i have to show my id but the scanner flashes red when it says show id making the driver think it s declined and they make me try again which makes it say just used train your driver s please

-----------
i just used it again 5 minutes ago it shows a red flashing light and a denied sound no yellow light

are low income passes going to be available through the my fare app

-----------
i reccomend purchasing paper tickets if you re a frequent user if purchasing tickets through the app they expire 7 days from the date of purchase even if they havent been activated

-----------
i understand that and it makes sense the show id message needs to last alot longer and flash a different colour

-----------
do all the buses accept this now

-----------
when are y 2019all gon na put apple pay or tap interac in them buses

-----------
thanks this is a game changer sometimes i forget my wallet

-----------
why is this set up so single tickets expire in seven days

-----------
took me 5 seconds to find it not difficult

-----------
buying a ticket for a bus or train with apple pay yes app is based off of thanks yyctransit

-----------
it works you are the user tester

-----------
i almost bought one 2014not to actually ride the bus but just to see if it works

-----------
you can buy one and have 7 days to then activate it

-----------
so far it 2019s pretty straight forward in terms for the train just makes it easier to buy things on the way to the station and then activate curious how it will work on the bus

-----------
only one way to find out

-----------
but you 2019re not buying a book your buying a single ticket

-----------
why are your bus drivers trying to make us throw out a validated ticket to give us a transfer isn t the point to reduce contact points

-----------
or buying multiple tickets

-----------
buying a ticket for a bus or train with apple pay yes app is based off of thanks yyctransit 2026

why do they expire

-----------
but why do the tickets expire

-----------
why do completely unused tickets on the myfare app expire after 7 days

-----------
oh no this is also what i am the most worried about are masks mandatory

-----------
thank you as more and more people return to work i wish they would become mandatory

-----------
and if dont use smartphone

-----------
it would be the stop at intersection 52st ne and skyview ranch landing ne not sure what the stop number is unfortunately

-----------
i completely agree there shouldn t be an expiration date on single tickets not to mention how many people in the city can not afford to buy more tickets often if their plans or medical appts change and they cant use it and lose that money there are people on tight budgets

-----------
how do you use apple pay with myfare

-----------
here

-----------
i wholeheartedly agree

caution if you do buy single tickets make sure you use them before they expire

with the new my fare app as a parent can i log in and purchase a youth monthly pass and 201csend give share it with my teenager

-----------
probably should consider ysing a pic of someone boarding the bus with a mask 2026 at least for a few months

-----------
perhaps only people wearing a mask should be able to enter the front doors

-----------
i m starting to agree based on accounts from

-----------
thanks i sometime take transit while supporting a person with a disability he wears his mask to protect others others should also protect him

-----------
no distancing no masks except me make them mandatory

loaded myfare app for my iphone but when i look at the conditions single ride tickets expire after 7 days is that right

-----------
why

-----------
are you saying the emergency ticket i ve carried in my wallet since 2007 has been replaced by technology

-----------
works great but i wish tickets didn t expire in a week could that be set for a month i d like to just buy a batch in advance instead of one by one

-----------
it s pretty great i like the countdown that tells you how much time is left l a ticket too

-----------
making masks mandatory on transit would help bolster passenger loads would it not shouldn t that happen covid isn t going away its still here and will be for awhile

-----------
why can t you guys also digitize the low income bus pass would be nice to not have to wait for them to arrive in the mail just thought i would give my 2 cents

-----------


-----------


-----------
if i have a monthly pass new my fare pass do i scan it every time when i get on a bus or just show it to driver

-----------
oh thank you

-----------
what is the purpose behind the 7 day expiration

-----------
why do your online tickets expire 7 days after purchase is there a reason for this the paper tickets were good for as long as you held them so why should the tickets via my app be any different
