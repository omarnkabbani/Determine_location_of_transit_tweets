-----------
ctriders 100 000 customers a day are using our transit system during the covid19 pandemic we want to hear from our 2026

-----------
and before this pandemic i have not thought that your schedules have been even half decent

-----------
take a seat michaelle

-----------
i am essentially talking about all bus routes that said i have been frustrated by the 10 the 22 66 13 what was the 73 20 one that goes to mckenzie town centre and more

-----------
and yes as far as timing i am not talking about during this covid 19 period thank you

-----------
i have done so many times on multiple occasions i have asked you guys to have buses running every 15 min s more than that like every 1 2 hour is not acceptable thank you

-----------
pollute more because a bus carries more than one person around and does not pollute as much as if each of these people taking the bus were to drive a car

-----------
thanks for all that you do to keep transit moving my only way to really get around with permanent disability and a walker

-----------
pollute more what do busses run on how long do busses run in a day how long do i run my vehicle in one day you 2019re blind if you think our current public transportation decreases greenhouse gasses

-----------
true however more bus drivers more tax payers amp employed people and may also mean more people taking the bus and less pollution and less wear and tear on the roads assuming less car drivers

-----------
wrong i 2019m not sure what world you 2019re living in how does any type of anything increase with operation costs decrease more busses more drivers more busses more maintenance plus cost to buy new

-----------
so you can pollute more for yourself for your own needs adding to greenhouse gases which are currently decreasing as people are driving less now

-----------
totally makes sense that 2019s why i have a car you can buy one in kijiji for 2k that will get you from a to b that 2019s not much more than a year of public transportation passes

-----------
actually more transit would be less need for security and less lost wages for those who use transit to get to work etc

-----------
but michaella have you at all looked how much money it costs to run the public transit we currently have wages maintenance new cars security etc everything would have to increase how much more taxes are you willing to pay get a bike or a moped

-----------
the buses don t always or often coordinate well with each other aside from that why should i spend a life time waiting around when i have a million of other things that i could be doing that would help me get more done in my day

-----------
even if one catches a bus on time if you need to catch a second one you still end up waiting half and hour longer than necessary

-----------
thank you

-----------
so for it to be more convenient for you because you can 2019t time bus routes properly you think the city should spend millions and millions of tax payer dollars so you can have a bus there every 15 minutes instead of every 30 minutes good thing you 2019re not in charge

-----------
i m still working so i rely on it

-----------
for a 6 30 start because my spouse can drop me off on their way to their job and i can avoid the whole mess of taking the bus

-----------
honestly i am doing everything i can to avoid taking transit right now you don 2019t know who is riding with you and social distancing doesn 2019t happen much of the time busses are often filthy too despite claims about how much they are cleaned sometimes i get to work at 4 30 am

-----------
outside of a pandemic one cool thing would be to advertise say on the radio all the benefits amp reasons it is good to take public transit amp why it is actually better than to drive reducing pollution amp accidents thereby decreasing the strain on healthcare and its costs etc

-----------
hi my neighbor is doing reno s in his house which isnt the problem the issues is stupid company driver s parking in this bus stop everytime

-----------
furthermore i want to waste as few days of my short mortal life being stuck being bored and sometimes in pain because it is so cold waiting for buses every 1 2 hour service during normal times sucks

-----------
shuttle buses are 24 to 27 feet in length the suggested distancing is 6 feet between two people but the shuttle buses have 10 passengers seating limit in covid 19 please explain so that i feel safe using transit

-----------
i do not want to be punished for making the environmentally responsible decision of not driving and taking a bus instead

-----------
well transit is still important to me because this is my only way of transportation going to work so thank you calgary transit for your service eventhough the busses are late and sometimes dirty

-----------
fixed it i had to clear the app data and its cache in order for it to work properly

-----------
i just wished as an essential worker we could get a discount on monthly bus passes like the low income don 2019t have to get one until may
